## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- SOL tokens (use Solana devnet faucet for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd coinflip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Getting Test SOL

For testing on devnet:
1. Visit [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Request devnet SOL

```

## Configuration

### Network Settings
The app is currently configured for Solana devnet. To switch to mainnet:

1. Update `WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet` to `WalletAdapterNetwork.MainnetBeta` in `WalletProvider.tsx`
2. Ensure you have real SOL tokens in your wallet

### Platform Wallet
In production, replace the placeholder platform wallet address with your actual platform wallet:

```typescript
// In utils/solana.ts
export const PLATFORM_WALLET = new PublicKey('YOUR_PLATFORM_WALLET_ADDRESS');
```

## Security Considerations

- **Random Number Generation**: Current implementation uses client-side randomness. For production, consider using Chainlink VRF or similar verifiable random functions
- **Platform Wallet Security**: Ensure your platform wallet is properly secured
- **Transaction Validation**: Always validate transactions on the blockchain
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
